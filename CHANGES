v2.2.0

- Return the response `Body` as part of a `BadResponseError`

v2.1.2
------

- Fix implicit dependency of v2/extensions/replay on v1 and references to v1
  documentation

v2.1.1
------

- Fix issue with v2 not being published properly as a module

v2.1.0
------

- Add concrete error types to package to make checking errors easier (rather
  than returning errors dynamically from functions that would require string
  checking). See also https://github.com/sigmavirus24/gobayeux/pull/20

- Fix bug where message extensions were applied after messages were already
  encoded. See also https://github.com/sigmavirus24/gobayeux/pull/12

v2.0.0
------

- It appears that most clients handle the "subscription" field of a message as
  a string despite the specification clearly stating it can be an array of
  strings. As a result, we've changed the definition and how we build
  subscription messages.

v1.0.0
------

- Finalize API for client work
